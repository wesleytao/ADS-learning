+ Projec title: The Colloquialism Trend in the President inaguration Speeches
+ This project is conducted by Wenyi Tao

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In this project,I would like to investigate the colloquialism trend in president inaguration speech. Colloquialism means the use of ordinary or familiar words or phrases.Back to the history, the president inauguration speeches are seems to have more emphasis on the topics about the foundation of Unites States. The people who have voting rights are well-educated and belong to the upper class. However, nowadays the inauguration speeches are tending to use plain languages. This might be a strategy to send messages to the people from all level of society.
